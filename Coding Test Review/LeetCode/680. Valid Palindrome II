📌 Problem Name
680. Valid Palindrome II

🗂 Category / Type
Two Pointers / String Validation

🔍 My Initial Approach
Used two pointers to check if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends.
When a mismatch occurred, checked if deleting either the left character or the right character could still form a valid palindrome by calling a helper function isPalindrome.
The helper function simply used a while loop to validate the remaining substring without recursion.

❌ What Went Wrong / Why It Failed
Initially misunderstood how to handle mismatches: incorrectly handled deletion logic or only compared a single character rather than checking the entire substring.
Also, forgot that after a mismatch, both possibilities (skip left or skip right) must be tried to satisfy "at most one deletion" condition.

✅ Final Solution Summary
Used two pointers: first starting from the beginning, and last from the end.
Compared characters; if they matched, moved pointers inward.
If characters did not match, immediately attempted two cases:
Check if skipping the left character makes the remaining substring a palindrome.
Check if skipping the right character makes the remaining substring a palindrome.

Helper function isPalindrome uses a simple while loop to verify palindrome status, ensuring efficient O(N) time complexity.

🧠 Key Takeaways / What I Learned
For problems allowing "one modification" (like deletion), both branches (left skip, right skip) must be carefully considered.
A simple while-based helper method is often safer and faster than recursion for long strings.
Clear pointer movement and consistent boundary checking are essential in two-pointer problems to avoid off-by-one errors.

💬 Additional Thoughts / Retrospective
In future problems with similar "at most one modification" conditions, I'll first think about when to branch and how to validate after branching.
Also, I'll avoid unnecessary recursion unless absolutely needed, and stick with simple loops when performance matters (especially with large inputs).
