📌 **Problem Name**
3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

🗂 **Category / Type**
Sliding Window / HashSet / Two Pointers

❌ **What Went Wrong / Why It Failed**
Initially tried to brute-force all substrings, which resulted in time limit exceeded. Didn’t consider how sliding window + set can help reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

🧠 **Key Takeaways / What I Learned**
* The sliding window technique is powerful when tracking continuous segments with constraints.
* Use a `Set` to efficiently track seen characters and detect duplicates in O(1).
* Move the `left` pointer only as much as needed — don’t reset it completely.

🐱 **Point**
1. Use `Set<Character>` to track characters in the current window.
2. Move `left` pointer forward only when a duplicate is found.
3. Always update `maxLength` with `right - left + 1` whenever the window is valid.
4. Efficient and clean logic makes this approach suitable even for large inputs.
