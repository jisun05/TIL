📌 Problem Name
141. Linked List Cycle (https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

🗂 Category / Type
Two Pointers / Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare

🔍 My Initial Approach
I experimented with modifying next pointers to mark visited nodes.

❌What Went Wrong / Why It Failed
Moving both pointers equally never changed their separation inside the cycle, so they just “chased” each other without meeting.
Altering next pointers broke the list structure and risked losing the original links.


✅ Final Solution Summary
Use two pointers
This leverages the fact that in a cycle, the fast pointer gains one node per iteration on the slow pointer, guaranteeing they’ll collide.

🧠 Key Takeaways / What I Learned
Always create a speed difference (2 vs. 1) so pointers converge inside a cycle.
Pre-check fast and fast.next for null before a two-step advance to avoid exceptions.
Starting fast one node ahead of slow avoids a false positive at the very beginning.
This approach runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space.
