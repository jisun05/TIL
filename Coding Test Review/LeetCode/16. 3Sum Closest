📌 Problem Name
16. 3Sum Closest

🗂 Category / Type
Two Pointers / Array Manipulation

❌ What Went Wrong / Why It Failed
Incorrectly initialized result with 0 instead of a valid sum of three elements.
Mistakenly treated the second pointer as a value, not an index.
Wrongly checked duplicates on second instead of first.
Confused between sum and result when returning the answer.
Improper immediate return condition by checking result == target instead of sum == target.

🧠 Key Takeaways / What I Learned
Always initialize result with a valid sum.
Use indices, not values, for pointers.
Check duplicates on the fixed first index.
Return result, not sum, after traversal.
Directly compare sum == target for immediate return.

🐱 Point

Sort before two-pointers.

Initialize result properly.

Handle pointer movement and duplicate checks carefully.
